    title: '11 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started My Business',
    body: `My name is Stephanie St.Claire, and I am an unfunded entrepreneur.
     I’ve been in business for 7 years, after engaging in my own personal and 
     tenuous renaissance (uh... divorce) and rediscovering my Divine Core 
     Purpose. In other words, I grew a pair of ladyballs, launched a business, 
     and tried to make enough money to keep a roof over my head.

    But there was a LOT to learn, and some of those things weren’t covered in 
    Who Moved My Cheese.
    
    Glitter was literally shooting out of my eye sockets as I quit my PR firm 
    job and started my own business. Full of optimism, living in New York City, 
    and surrounded by a tribe of friends who were also launching businesses, 
    art, and gigs, I felt it was the perfect time to make the bold move to 
    entrepreneurship. I was now officially living my dream and working for 
    myself which meant that I was in charge of my financial destiny and captain
     of my promising future.
     
     Luckily my initial hyper-optimism buoyed me whilst, oscillating between 
     euphoria and despair, I was slowly but systematically forced off The Magic
      School Bus and onto the S.S. Battleship Long Haul.
      
      I was a quick and eager learner, but despite the hours of webinar 
      watching, countless Friday nights pumping out site copy, and teaching 
      myself everything I could about HTML, there were just some things I didn’t
       get. I had to fall on my ass to procure the “masters degree in life 
       survival” every entrepreneur has to earn on their “journey.”

       Yes, those are bitterly gesticulated air quotes.

       Here are 11 things I wish I knew when I started my business. I hope they
        will save you some time, but at the very least, some anguish because - 
        experience is a good teacher here — the sodium from your tears acts as a
         corrosive melting agent on all brands of premium ice cream, but 
        otherwise, makes a superb saline for your dirty martini. Cry over a cup,
          oh fathomless bird of preneurial gumption!
          
          1. Running the business is your first priority.
          2. Ready to meet your soulmate? It’s you.
          3. Your trajectory for success will take as long as everyone else’s, 
          even though you’re special and brilliant.
          4. Running out of money is a common part of the journey.
          5. Build a hybrid stream of income.
          6. Do the work.
          7. Spend less time researching, more time doing.
          8. Only say yes to clients/collaborative projects that are HELL YESes.
          9. You must devote time to become a brilliant marketer. Must.
          10. Email will be your new best frenemy.
          11. Well, it’s a hodge-podge.`,

    title: '10 Best Tips on How to Woo a Girl and Win Her Over',
    body: `Approaching a lady you really like can be challenging.
     Many men struggle with this moment a lot. Are there tips that
      could help you improve your performance? Let’s break down the
       whole process of wooing the lady into stages and see what we
        can do!

    How to woo a girl step by step:
    Where does courting start? Does it start at the bar or some other
     place where you meet the girl? No, it starts while you are alone at home.
      How’s that? Take a look!
      
      1. Getting tuned up!
      Women are sensitive creatures. Most of them possess some measure of 
      empathy and can see right through you. This means if you are afraid 
      or overly nervous approaching them, they can feel it. And since most 
      girls like confident men, you get a huge disadvantage.
So, even before you go out to meet women, you need to create the right mindset.
 What should it be? The little nerve is Ok, but too much is no good. Boost your
  self-confidence. Remember that we all are humans and none of us is perfect. 
  She may look hot, but she is not perfect. She wants to be understood, and she 
  craves love. So, there is that vulnerability inside her.
Most guys fail to court ladies just because they get too focused on themselves: 
on their looks, coolness, etc. What they fail to see is the woman they interact 
with. She has needs, too. She also feels insecure and maybe even lonely. If you
 can understand that and help her feel better, you can win her!
 
 2. Be courteous
Once you two go on a date, be the best version of you. Hold the door for her.
 Move up her chair. Get her coat. All these things may seem old-fashioned or 
 outdated in our modern and feminized community, but they work!

3. Make yourself available
This helps her to feel safer and more secure. How do you do that? Give her a 
call once in a while. Text her time to time. Do it several times a day. 
Contact her on social media, like her posts and write her a comment. This 
clearly shows your interest in her and makes you available for communication.
 Chase her, women like that, but do not cross then line and do not stalk her!
 
 4. Pay for the dates
Not her, of course. Pay the bills during the dates. Some girls like to split 
them, but it’s nice when the man pays. The only thing you get for free is the
 cheese in a mousetrap. Dating is and should be costly! No complaints about 
 that, guys. After all, it would cost you even more, if you marry her! So, 
 get ready.

5. Don’t worry, be happy
Stay positive. Some guys become moody or take dates for the free therapy 
sessions. That woman is not there to hear about all your troubles in life!
 She is out to have fun and relax. She might have a bundle of her own 
 issues, and she is looking for someone to cheer her up. So, leave your
  misery at home and get some fun.

6. Turn off your phone
Gadgets are excellent, but there is nothing more annoying than a date, who
 always is checking their phone, emails or chatting with friends online. 
 That’s bad. Turn the phone off. You can even do it in front of her to show:
  she is special to you, and you will focus all your attention on her.

7. Bring flowers or gifts
Some guys complain about women not being really appreciative of their efforts.
 The only reason that happens is because guys are not paying attention. They 
 get it all wrong. If you have been few times out with that woman, you should
  know what flowers or colors she likes and what her hobbies are.
Go online. Browse through her profiles there. Most of the time you can get 
accurate info on her from her posts or shares. If the woman likes yellow roses,
 they would be all over her profiles! If she has a hobby, such as crafting or 
 yoga, you would see that, too. So, when you pick your little presents, you 
 can make them perfect by tuning them up to what she likes.

8. Offer your help
Single women have to deal with some things in life, where they need male help.
 She may require you to fix something at her place; to put up a picture on the
  wall, for instance. This is all part of wooing. Or, just offer her to go and
   do grocery shopping with her. Carry her heavy bags, make yourself useful. 
   That’s so sweet!

9. Listen to her!
That’s a big one. Women love to talk and share their feelings and experiences.
 Listening to her costs you nothing! It’s the cheapest and most efficient way
  to show her you care. Why not use it?

10. Keep your sexual desires down
Yeah, that’s hard. She is so hot, and you want her, but… Courting is not about 
sex. If that’s all you are interested in, see if she responds to that. If the 
girl is after lengthy relationship and you are after quick sex, be honest with
 her. Possibly all you need is to move on to the next girl!
But if you love her, put sex aside for the time being. Focus on her personality
 instead of her body. Get to know her better. Ask questions and listen to her
  answers. Spend quality time with her and get fun dates. Do something together.
   Like, offer her to go to a cooking class, where you two can interact, talk 
   and have fun.

Now you get the practical to-do list for wooing the woman. You can do it by 
text; you can do useful things for her to win her over. And you can be that 
sweet guy she has been dreaming of! So, go ahead and do these things to win
 her love.`,

    title: 'The First 8 Things You Must Conquer In A Startup.',
    body: `There are countless things to get done in a startup.

   The ‘to-do-list’ is an enormous one.
   
   But some are far more important than others. Lets start with
    the ones you should take on first, in the hope of laying 
    some solid foundations for your startup to work on.
   
   1. Know, and understand, your idea / vision.
Sounds obvious. You cannot have a startup company without an idea.

Thanks for the advice, dude.

However, you would be surprised how many startups believe they have
 an idea or company vision, but find it hard to clearly define.

The founder/founders may have trouble explaining it to others, or 
each founder may describe it differently when asked.

This is confusing and it will send mixed messages to potential investors
 or clients, and this will reflect badly.

You need to know the basics. Think of it as the two headings ‘what we 
are’ and the ‘who we are’.
Nail the 30 second elevator pitches. Know the company motto, or strap 
line. Have that shit on speed dial, and make sure the rest of the team do to.

2. Set out your startup’s values.
Similar to above, you need to set out values.

This is more of the ‘why we are’ and the ‘how we are’ stuff.
Within this you need to set some core values, which will help you, and 
other founders or employees, understand the wrongs and rights of working 
in the startup.

Adobe, for example, sets it’s values as Genuine, Exceptional, Innovative, 
Involved.

This will be hugely important if you consider expanding your team, or the 
company and the vision itself. It will keep everyone in check, and pushing 
in the same direction.

3. Know, and understand, who your target audience is.
You’ve got your great idea. You have set out your vision and your values. 
Next problem. Who are you going to sell this to?

You need to know your target market.

In fact, you need to know if there is a target market for your idea at all. 
(If there isn’t, consider revising point #1 again…)

Do some research. Are there similar products/services out there? Is 
the competition high or low? Are you entering a new market place, and 
aiming to be the brand leader?

Narrow down to a group of users, and gather some data about them. (Gender, 
  Age, Location, Job, Income, Situation, Environment, Retail Habits etc).
This, is your target audience, and this is who you need to sell your startup to

4. Work on your branding.
Once the company vision is understood, and your target market is identified, 
you now need a platform to help potential clients and customers reach you, 
and want you.

Enter your branding.

Your brand will help you target, gain work, beat competitors and sell.

The brand has to relate to your vision and your values. This will help 
reach the audience you need to make your startup a success.

Consider your tone. Think about your visual language. Make it clean and 
concise. Make it something that will become identifiable. Make it eye 
catching. Make it beautiful. Keep it simple.

“Determine who you are and what your brand is, and what you’re not. The 
rest of it is just a lot of noise.” — Geoffrey Zakarian

5. Decide on what platforms to market on.
This one shouldn’t be too difficult to nail down, as there are probably 
very few platforms that won’t be suitable.

You should be active on social media, regardless of how monotonous and
 painful it can be.

Get your startup’s social media accounts signed up, with all the relevant
 details added, and start building a following. Don’t spam your feeds with
  advertising and content pushing — remember to show the personal and human 
  side of your startup and it’s work.

Do you want to market through a website too? Don’t build a shit one. 
Too many fail to see the website as an extension of your startup, as part 
of the brand and portfolio.
Take some time and lots of effort on this one. Work on the looks. Get it 
running smoothly. Take some time to work on your SEO. And for the love of 
god, try to make it make it mobile friendly — this really matters these days!

There are many other avenues to market through, so take your time to decide 
what is best for your startup, and your target audience.

6. Do some maths.
Calculating figures of any form is a chore. Maths is horrible (and hard). 
And then there is the spreadsheets…

Unfortunately, it is essential.

Tackle this early on to determine a rough ‘bottom line’. You can use this as 
an indicator for what your startup needs to earn to survive. It dangerous
 to remain blind to this.

Add up your overheads. Add in projected wage costs. Add in expenses or 
purchases. Add in everything. Absolutely everything.

See that number, that looks frighteningly high? Thats your rough bottom 
line. I know, it hurts to look at.
That becomes the target, and the challenge becomes earning it, every, 
single, month.

7. Evaluate and highlight what areas you are short on.
This one requires a little honesty.

No matter if you think you can handle everything yourself, or within 
your wee team, you may be short. And thats ok.

You could be lacking in general manpower. It could also be something more 
specific. Is there a vital skillset missing within the team?
If so it is decision time. Is somebody taking on that job, and taking the 
time to learn the skill, or do you need to hire? Having calculated your bottom 
line, can you afford this? Is it a risk worth taking, perhaps in the short 
term, for long term gains?

If it is, get these guys on board, before the workload becomes too heavy. If 
it isn’t, throw yourself in the deep end and take on the challenge of learning 
a new role.

8. Set some goals.
This one is important.

You have to take baby steps in startup. Try not to aim for the top of the 
ladder before you have stepped on it. To prevent this, set some early goals.

It could be some sales targets, or maybe it is just getting the first sale. 
Maybe it is getting a website created. Getting the first prototype designed. 
Convincing the first 100 users to sign up to the app or website.

Whatever goals you set, try to keep them realistic, and reachable. It can be 
all too easy to shoot high - “lets make £1,000,000 this month!” — but these 
goals will remain unachieved and this can cause moral to drop.

You can always aim big, but but aim to get big in small, manageable steps.

    title: 'How to Make Your Future Habits Easy',
    body: ` While researching Atomic Habits, I came across a story that 
    immediately struck me with its simplicity and power. 
    It was the story of Oswald Nuckols, an IT developer from
     Natchez, Mississippi, and his simple strategy for making future
      habits easy.

    Nuckols refers to the approach as “resetting the room.”
    
    For instance, when he finishes watching television, he places the 
    remote back on the TV stand, arranges the pillows on the couch, and 
    folds the blanket. When he leaves his car, he throws any trash away.
     Whenever he takes a shower, he wipes down the toilet while the shower 
    is warming up. (As he notes, the “perfect time to clean the toilet is
       right before you wash yourself in the shower anyway.”)
    
    This might sound like he's just “cleaning up” but there is a key insight
     that makes his approach different. The purpose of resetting each 
    room is not simply to clean up after the last action, but to prepare for
     the next action.
    
    “When I walk into a room everything is in its right place,” Nuckols wrote.
     “Because I do this every day in every room, stuff always stays in 
    good shape . . . People think I work hard but I’m actually really lazy. 
    ’m just proactively lazy. It gives you so much time back.”
    
    I have written previously about the power of the environment to shape 
    \your behavior. Resetting the room is one way to put the power back in 
    your own hands. Let's talk about how you can use it.
    
    The Power of Priming the Environment

Whenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you are priming 
it to make the next action easy. This is one of the most practical and 
simple ways to improve your habits.

For instance, my wife keeps a box of greeting cards that are presorted by 
occasion—birthday, sympathy, wedding, graduation, and more. Whenever 
necessary, she grabs an appropriate card and sends it off. She is 
incredibly good at remembering to send cards because she has reduced
 the friction of doing so.

For years, I was the opposite. Someone would have a baby and I would 
think, “I should send a card.” But then weeks would pass and by the time I 
remembered to pick one up at the store, it was too late. The habit wasn’t easy.

There are many ways to prime your environment so it’s ready for immediate
 use. If you want to cook a healthy breakfast, place the skillet on the stove, 
set the cooking spray on the counter, and lay out any plates and utensils 
you’ll need the night before. When you wake up, making breakfast will be easy.

Here are some more:

    Want to draw more? Put your pencils, pens, notebooks, and drawing 
    tools on top of your desk, within easy reach.
    Want to exercise? Set out your workout clothes, shoes, gym bag, 
    and water bottle ahead of time.
    Want to improve your diet? Chop up a ton of fruits and vegetables 
    on weekends and pack them in containers, so you have easy access
     to healthy, ready-to-eat options during the week.

These are simple ways to make the good habit the path of least resistance.
The Path of Most Resistance

You can also invert this principle and prime the environment to make 
bad behaviors difficult.

If you find yourself watching too much television, for example, then

unplug it after each use. Only plug it back in if you can say out 
loud the name of the 
show you want to watch. (Which prevents you from turning on Netflix 
  and “just finding something” to watch.) This setup creates just enough 
  friction to prevent mindless viewing.

If that doesn’t do it, you can take it a step further. Unplug the 
television and take the batteries out of the remote after each use, 
so it takes an extra ten 
seconds to turn it back on. And if you’re really hard-core, move the 
television out of the living room and into a closet after each use. 
You can be sure you’ll 
only take it out when you really want to watch something. The greater
 the friction, the less likely the habit.

Whenever possible, I leave my phone in a different room until lunch.
 When it’s right next to me, I’ll check it all morning for no reason
  at all. But when it is 
in another room, I rarely think about it. And the friction is high 
enough that I won’t go get it without a reason. As a result, I get 
three to four hours each morning
 when I can work without interruption.

If sticking your phone in another room doesn’t seem like enough, tell 
a friend or family member to hide it from you for a few hours. Ask a 
coworker to keep it at their 
desk in the morning and give it back to you at lunch.

It is remarkable how little friction is required to prevent bad 
behavior. When I hide beer in the back of the fridge where I can’t 
see it, I drink less. When I delete 
social media apps from my phone, it can be weeks before I download
 them again and log in.

These tricks are unlikely to curb a true addiction, but for many 
of us, a little bit of friction can be the difference between 
sticking with a good habit or sliding 
into a bad one. Imagine the cumulative impact of making dozens of 
these changes and living in an environment designed to make the 
good behaviors easier and the bad behaviors harder.

    title: 'Why Facts Don’t Change Our Minds',
    body: ` The economist J.K. Galbraith once wrote, “Faced with 
    a choice between changing one’s mind and proving there is no
     need to do so, almost everyone gets busy with the
     proof.”

    Leo Tolstoy was even bolder: “The most difficult subjects can 
    be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed 
    any idea of them already; but the simplest thing 
    cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is 
    firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of 
    doubt, what is laid before him.”
    
    What's going on here? Why don't facts change our minds? And 
    why would someone continue to believe a false or inaccurate 
    idea anyway? How do such behaviors serve us?
    The Logic of False Beliefs
    
    Humans need a reasonably accurate view of the world in order
     to survive. If your model of reality is wildly different from
      the actual world, then you struggle to take effective 
    actions each day.
    
    However, truth and accuracy are not the only things that matter
     to the human mind. Humans also seem to have a deep desire to belong.
    
    In Atomic Habits, I wrote, “Humans are herd animals. We want 
    to fit in, to bond with others, and to earn the respect and 
    approval of our peers. Such inclinations are essential 
    to our survival. For most of our evolutionary history, our 
    ancestors lived in tribes. Becoming separated from the 
    tribe—or worse, being cast out—was a death sentence.”`,

 Narrow down to a group of users, and gather some data about them. (Gender, 
   Age, Location, Job, Income, Situation, Environment, Retail Habits etc).
 This, is your target audience, and this is who you need to sell your startup to
 
 4. Work on your branding.
 Once the company vision is understood, and your target market is identified, 
 you now need a platform to help potential clients and customers reach you, 
 and want you.
 
 Enter your branding.
 
 Your brand will help you target, gain work, beat competitors and sell.
 
 The brand has to relate to your vision and your values. This will help 
 reach the audience you need to make your startup a success.
 
 Consider your tone. Think about your visual language. Make it clean and 
 concise. Make it something that will become identifiable. Make it eye 
 catching. Make it beautiful. Keep it simple.
 
 “Determine who you are and what your brand is, and what you’re not. The 
 rest of it is just a lot of noise.” — Geoffrey Zakarian
 
 5. Decide on what platforms to market on.
 This one shouldn’t be too difficult to nail down, as there are probably 
 very few platforms that won’t be suitable.
 
 You should be active on social media, regardless of how monotonous and
  painful it can be.
 
 Get your startup’s social media accounts signed up, with all the relevant
  details added, and start building a following. Don’t spam your feeds with
   advertising and content pushing — remember to show the personal and human 
   side of your startup and it’s work.
 
 Do you want to market through a website too? Don’t build a shit one. 
 Too many fail to see the website as an extension of your startup, as part 
 of the brand and portfolio.
 Take some time and lots of effort on this one. Work on the looks. Get it 
 running smoothly. Take some time to work on your SEO. And for the love of 
 god, try to make it make it mobile friendly — this really matters these days!
 
 There are many other avenues to market through, so take your time to decide 
 what is best for your startup, and your target audience.
 
 6. Do some maths.
 Calculating figures of any form is a chore. Maths is horrible (and hard). 
 And then there is the spreadsheets…
 
 Unfortunately, it is essential.
 
 Tackle this early on to determine a rough ‘bottom line’. You can use this as 
 an indicator for what your startup needs to earn to survive. It dangerous
  to remain blind to this.
 
 Add up your overheads. Add in projected wage costs. Add in expenses or 
 purchases. Add in everything. Absolutely everything.
 
 See that number, that looks frighteningly high? Thats your rough bottom 
 line. I know, it hurts to look at.
 That becomes the target, and the challenge becomes earning it, every, 
 single, month.
 
 7. Evaluate and highlight what areas you are short on.
 This one requires a little honesty.
 
 No matter if you think you can handle everything yourself, or within 
 your wee team, you may be short. And thats ok.
 
 You could be lacking in general manpower. It could also be something more 
 specific. Is there a vital skillset missing within the team?
 If so it is decision time. Is somebody taking on that job, and taking the 
 time to learn the skill, or do you need to hire? Having calculated your bottom 
 line, can you afford this? Is it a risk worth taking, perhaps in the short 
 term, for long term gains?
 
 If it is, get these guys on board, before the workload becomes too heavy. If 
 it isn’t, throw yourself in the deep end and take on the challenge of learning 
 a new role.
 
 8. Set some goals.
 This one is important.
 
 You have to take baby steps in startup. Try not to aim for the top of the 
 ladder before you have stepped on it. To prevent this, set some early goals.
 
 It could be some sales targets, or maybe it is just getting the first sale. 
 Maybe it is getting a website created. Getting the first prototype designed. 
 Convincing the first 100 users to sign up to the app or website.
 
 Whatever goals you set, try to keep them realistic, and reachable. It can be 
 all too easy to shoot high - “lets make £1,000,000 this month!” — but these 
 goals will remain unachieved and this can cause moral to drop.
 
 You can always aim big, but but aim to get big in small, manageable steps.

    The ‘to-do-list’ is an enormous one.
    
    But some are far more important than others. Lets start with
     the ones you should take on first, in the hope of laying 
     some solid foundations for your startup to work on.
    
    1. Know, and understand, your idea / vision.
 Sounds obvious. You cannot have a startup company without an idea.
 
 Thanks for the advice, dude.
 
 However, you would be surprised how many startups believe they have
  an idea or company vision, but find it hard to clearly define.
 
 The founder/founders may have trouble explaining it to others, or 
 each founder may describe it differently when asked.
 
 This is confusing and it will send mixed messages to potential investors
  or clients, and this will reflect badly.
 
 You need to know the basics. Think of it as the two headings ‘what we 
 are’ and the ‘who we are’.
 Nail the 30 second elevator pitches. Know the company motto, or strap 
 line. Have that shit on speed dial, and make sure the rest of the team do to.
 
 2. Set out your startup’s values.
 Similar to above, you need to set out values.
 
 This is more of the ‘why we are’ and the ‘how we are’ stuff.
 Within this you need to set some core values, which will help you, and 
 other founders or employees, understand the wrongs and rights of working 
 in the startup.
 
 Adobe, for example, sets it’s values as Genuine, Exceptional, Innovative, 
 Involved.
 
 This will be hugely important if you consider expanding your team, or the 
 company and the vision itself. It will keep everyone in check, and pushing 
 in the same direction.
 
 3. Know, and understand, who your target audience is.
 You’ve got your great idea. You have set out your vision and your values. 
 Next problem. Who are you going to sell this to?
 
 You need to know your target market.
 
 In fact, you need to know if there is a target market for your idea at all. 
 (If there isn’t, consider revising point #1 again…)
 
 Do some research. Are there similar products/services out there? Is 
 the competition high or low? Are you entering a new market place, and 
 aiming to be the brand leader?

 “Determine who you are and what your brand is, and what you’re not. The 
 rest of it is just a lot of noise.” — Geoffrey Zakarian
 
 5. Decide on what platforms to market on.
 This one shouldn’t be too difficult to nail down, as there are probably 
 very few platforms that won’t be suitable.
 
 You should be active on social media, regardless of how monotonous and
  painful it can be.
 
 Get your startup’s social media accounts signed up, with all the relevant
  details added, and start building a following. Don’t spam your feeds with
   advertising and content pushing — remember to show the personal and human 
   side of your startup and it’s work.
 
 Do you want to market through a website too? Don’t build a shit one. 
 Too many fail to see the website as an extension of your startup, as part 
 of the brand and portfolio.
 Take some time and lots of effort on this one. Work on the looks. Get it 
 running smoothly. Take some time to work on your SEO. And for the love of 
 god, try to make it make it mobile friendly — this really matters these days!
 
 There are many other avenues to market through, so take your time to decide 
 what is best for your startup, and your target audience.
 
 6. Do some maths.
 Calculating figures of any form is a chore. Maths is horrible (and hard). 
 And then there is the spreadsheets…
 
 Unfortunately, it is essential.
 
 Tackle this early on to determine a rough ‘bottom line’. You can use this as 
 an indicator for what your startup needs to earn to survive. It dangerous
  to remain blind to this.
 
 Add up your overheads. Add in projected wage costs. Add in expenses or 
 purchases. Add in everything. Absolutely everything.
 
 See that number, that looks frighteningly high? Thats your rough bottom 
 line. I know, it hurts to look at.
 That becomes the target, and the challenge becomes earning it, every, 
 single, month.
 
 7. Evaluate and highlight what areas you are short on.
 This one requires a little honesty.
 
 No matter if you think you can handle everything yourself, or within 
 your wee team, you may be short. And thats ok.
 
 You could be lacking in general manpower. It could also be something more 
 specific. Is there a vital skillset missing within the team?
 If so it is decision time. Is somebody taking on that job, and taking the 
 time to learn the skill, or do you need to hire? Having calculated your bottom 
 line, can you afford this? Is it a risk worth taking, perhaps in the short 
 term, for long term gains?
 
 If it is, get these guys on board, before the workload becomes too heavy. If 
 it isn’t, throw yourself in the deep end and take on the challenge of learning 
 a new role.
 
 8. Set some goals.
 This one is important.
 
 You have to take baby steps in startup. Try not to aim for the top of the 
 ladder before you have stepped on it. To prevent this, set some early goals.
 
 It could be some sales targets, or maybe it is just getting the first sale. 
 Maybe it is getting a website created. Getting the first prototype designed. 
 Convincing the first 100 users to sign up to the app or website.
 
 Whatever goals you set, try to keep them realistic, and reachable. It can be 
 all too easy to shoot high - “lets make £1,000,000 this month!” — but these 
 goals will remain unachieved and this can cause moral to drop.
 
 You can always aim big, but but aim to get big in small, manageable steps.

    The ‘to-do-list’ is an enormous one.
    
    But some are far more important than others. Lets start with
     the ones you should take on first, in the hope of laying 
     some solid foundations for your startup to work on.
    
    1. Know, and understand, your idea / vision.
 Sounds obvious. You cannot have a startup company without an idea.
 
 Thanks for the advice, dude.
 
 However, you would be surprised how many startups believe they have
  an idea or company vision, but find it hard to clearly define.
 
 The founder/founders may have trouble explaining it to others, or 
 each founder may describe it differently when asked.
 
 This is confusing and it will send mixed messages to potential investors
  or clients, and this will reflect badly.
 
 You need to know the basics. Think of it as the two headings ‘what we 
 are’ and the ‘who we are’.
 Nail the 30 second elevator pitches. Know the company motto, or strap 
 line. Have that shit on speed dial, and make sure the rest of the team do to.
 
 2. Set out your startup’s values.
 Similar to above, you need to set out values.
 
 This is more of the ‘why we are’ and the ‘how we are’ stuff.
 Within this you need to set some core values, which will help you, and 
 other founders or employees, understand the wrongs and rights of working 
 in the startup.
 
 Adobe, for example, sets it’s values as Genuine, Exceptional, Innovative, 
 Involved.
 
 This will be hugely important if you consider expanding your team, or the 
 company and the vision itself. It will keep everyone in check, and pushing 
 in the same direction.
 
 3. Know, and understand, who your target audience is.
 You’ve got your great idea. You have set out your vision and your values. 
 Next problem. Who are you going to sell this to?
 
 You need to know your target market.
 
 In fact, you need to know if there is a target market for your idea at all. 
 (If there isn’t, consider revising point #1 again…)
 
 Do some research. Are there similar products/services out there? Is 
 the competition high or low? Are you entering a new market place, and 
 aiming to be the brand leader?
 
 Narrow down to a group of users, and gather some data about them. (Gender, 
   Age, Location, Job, Income, Situation, Environment, Retail Habits etc).
 This, is your target audience, and this is who you need to sell your startup to
 
 4. Work on your branding.
 Once the company vision is understood, and your target market is identified, 
 you now need a platform to help potential clients and customers reach you, 
 and want you.
 
 Enter your branding.
 
 Your brand will help you target, gain work, beat competitors and sell.
 
 The brand has to relate to your vision and your values. This will help 
 reach the audience you need to make your startup a success.
 
 Consider your tone. Think about your visual language. Make it clean and 
 concise. Make it something that will become identifiable. Make it eye 
 catching. Make it beautiful. Keep it simple.
