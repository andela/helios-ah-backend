    title: '11 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started My Business',
    body: `My name is Stephanie St.Claire, and I am an unfunded entrepreneur.
     I’ve been in business for 7 years, after engaging in my own personal and 
     tenuous renaissance (uh... divorce) and rediscovering my Divine Core 
     Purpose. In other words, I grew a pair of ladyballs, launched a business, 
     and tried to make enough money to keep a roof over my head.

    But there was a LOT to learn, and some of those things weren’t covered in 
    Who Moved My Cheese.
    
    Glitter was literally shooting out of my eye sockets as I quit my PR firm 
    job and started my own business. Full of optimism, living in New York City, 
    and surrounded by a tribe of friends who were also launching businesses, 
    art, and gigs, I felt it was the perfect time to make the bold move to 
    entrepreneurship. I was now officially living my dream and working for 
    myself which meant that I was in charge of my financial destiny and captain
     of my promising future.
     
     Luckily my initial hyper-optimism buoyed me whilst, oscillating between 
     euphoria and despair, I was slowly but systematically forced off The Magic
      School Bus and onto the S.S. Battleship Long Haul.
      
      I was a quick and eager learner, but despite the hours of webinar 
      watching, countless Friday nights pumping out site copy, and teaching 
      myself everything I could about HTML, there were just some things I didn’t
       get. I had to fall on my ass to procure the “masters degree in life 
       survival” every entrepreneur has to earn on their “journey.”

       Yes, those are bitterly gesticulated air quotes.

       Here are 11 things I wish I knew when I started my business. I hope they
        will save you some time, but at the very least, some anguish because - 
        experience is a good teacher here — the sodium from your tears acts as a
         corrosive melting agent on all brands of premium ice cream, but 
        otherwise, makes a superb saline for your dirty martini. Cry over a cup,
          oh fathomless bird of preneurial gumption!
          
          1. Running the business is your first priority.
          2. Ready to meet your soulmate? It’s you.
          3. Your trajectory for success will take as long as everyone else’s, 
          even though you’re special and brilliant.
          4. Running out of money is a common part of the journey.
          5. Build a hybrid stream of income.
          6. Do the work.
          7. Spend less time researching, more time doing.
          8. Only say yes to clients/collaborative projects that are HELL YESes.
          9. You must devote time to become a brilliant marketer. Must.
          10. Email will be your new best frenemy.
          11. Well, it’s a hodge-podge.`,

    title: '10 Best Tips on How to Woo a Girl and Win Her Over',
    body: `Approaching a lady you really like can be challenging.
     Many men struggle with this moment a lot. Are there tips that
      could help you improve your performance? Let’s break down the
       whole process of wooing the lady into stages and see what we
        can do!

    How to woo a girl step by step:
    Where does courting start? Does it start at the bar or some other
     place where you meet the girl? No, it starts while you are alone at home.
      How’s that? Take a look!
      
      1. Getting tuned up!
      Women are sensitive creatures. Most of them possess some measure of 
      empathy and can see right through you. This means if you are afraid 
      or overly nervous approaching them, they can feel it. And since most 
      girls like confident men, you get a huge disadvantage.
So, even before you go out to meet women, you need to create the right mindset.
 What should it be? The little nerve is Ok, but too much is no good. Boost your
  self-confidence. Remember that we all are humans and none of us is perfect. 
  She may look hot, but she is not perfect. She wants to be understood, and she 
  craves love. So, there is that vulnerability inside her.
Most guys fail to court ladies just because they get too focused on themselves: 
on their looks, coolness, etc. What they fail to see is the woman they interact 
with. She has needs, too. She also feels insecure and maybe even lonely. If you
 can understand that and help her feel better, you can win her!
 
 2. Be courteous
Once you two go on a date, be the best version of you. Hold the door for her.
 Move up her chair. Get her coat. All these things may seem old-fashioned or 
 outdated in our modern and feminized community, but they work!

3. Make yourself available
This helps her to feel safer and more secure. How do you do that? Give her a 
call once in a while. Text her time to time. Do it several times a day. 
Contact her on social media, like her posts and write her a comment. This 
clearly shows your interest in her and makes you available for communication.
 Chase her, women like that, but do not cross then line and do not stalk her!
 
 4. Pay for the dates
Not her, of course. Pay the bills during the dates. Some girls like to split 
them, but it’s nice when the man pays. The only thing you get for free is the
 cheese in a mousetrap. Dating is and should be costly! No complaints about 
 that, guys. After all, it would cost you even more, if you marry her! So, 
 get ready.

5. Don’t worry, be happy
Stay positive. Some guys become moody or take dates for the free therapy 
sessions. That woman is not there to hear about all your troubles in life!
 She is out to have fun and relax. She might have a bundle of her own 
 issues, and she is looking for someone to cheer her up. So, leave your
  misery at home and get some fun.

6. Turn off your phone
Gadgets are excellent, but there is nothing more annoying than a date, who
 always is checking their phone, emails or chatting with friends online. 
 That’s bad. Turn the phone off. You can even do it in front of her to show:
  she is special to you, and you will focus all your attention on her.

7. Bring flowers or gifts
Some guys complain about women not being really appreciative of their efforts.
 The only reason that happens is because guys are not paying attention. They 
 get it all wrong. If you have been few times out with that woman, you should
  know what flowers or colors she likes and what her hobbies are.
Go online. Browse through her profiles there. Most of the time you can get 
accurate info on her from her posts or shares. If the woman likes yellow roses,
 they would be all over her profiles! If she has a hobby, such as crafting or 
 yoga, you would see that, too. So, when you pick your little presents, you 
 can make them perfect by tuning them up to what she likes.

8. Offer your help
Single women have to deal with some things in life, where they need male help.
 She may require you to fix something at her place; to put up a picture on the
  wall, for instance. This is all part of wooing. Or, just offer her to go and
   do grocery shopping with her. Carry her heavy bags, make yourself useful. 
   That’s so sweet!

9. Listen to her!
That’s a big one. Women love to talk and share their feelings and experiences.
 Listening to her costs you nothing! It’s the cheapest and most efficient way
  to show her you care. Why not use it?

10. Keep your sexual desires down
Yeah, that’s hard. She is so hot, and you want her, but… Courting is not about 
sex. If that’s all you are interested in, see if she responds to that. If the 
girl is after lengthy relationship and you are after quick sex, be honest with
 her. Possibly all you need is to move on to the next girl!
But if you love her, put sex aside for the time being. Focus on her personality
 instead of her body. Get to know her better. Ask questions and listen to her
  answers. Spend quality time with her and get fun dates. Do something together.
   Like, offer her to go to a cooking class, where you two can interact, talk 
   and have fun.

Now you get the practical to-do list for wooing the woman. You can do it by 
text; you can do useful things for her to win her over. And you can be that 
sweet guy she has been dreaming of! So, go ahead and do these things to win
 her love.`,

    title: 'The First 8 Things You Must Conquer In A Startup.',
    body: `There are countless things to get done in a startup.

   The ‘to-do-list’ is an enormous one.
   
   But some are far more important than others. Lets start with
    the ones you should take on first, in the hope of laying 
    some solid foundations for your startup to work on.
   
   1. Know, and understand, your idea / vision.
Sounds obvious. You cannot have a startup company without an idea.

Thanks for the advice, dude.

However, you would be surprised how many startups believe they have
 an idea or company vision, but find it hard to clearly define.

The founder/founders may have trouble explaining it to others, or 
each founder may describe it differently when asked.

This is confusing and it will send mixed messages to potential investors
 or clients, and this will reflect badly.

You need to know the basics. Think of it as the two headings ‘what we 
are’ and the ‘who we are’.
Nail the 30 second elevator pitches. Know the company motto, or strap 
line. Have that shit on speed dial, and make sure the rest of the team do to.

2. Set out your startup’s values.
Similar to above, you need to set out values.

This is more of the ‘why we are’ and the ‘how we are’ stuff.
Within this you need to set some core values, which will help you, and 
other founders or employees, understand the wrongs and rights of working 
in the startup.

Adobe, for example, sets it’s values as Genuine, Exceptional, Innovative, 
Involved.

This will be hugely important if you consider expanding your team, or the 
company and the vision itself. It will keep everyone in check, and pushing 
in the same direction.

3. Know, and understand, who your target audience is.
You’ve got your great idea. You have set out your vision and your values. 
Next problem. Who are you going to sell this to?

You need to know your target market.

In fact, you need to know if there is a target market for your idea at all. 
(If there isn’t, consider revising point #1 again…)

Do some research. Are there similar products/services out there? Is 
the competition high or low? Are you entering a new market place, and 
aiming to be the brand leader?

Narrow down to a group of users, and gather some data about them. (Gender, 
  Age, Location, Job, Income, Situation, Environment, Retail Habits etc).
This, is your target audience, and this is who you need to sell your startup to.

4. Work on your branding.
Once the company vision is understood, and your target market is identified, 
you now need a platform to help potential clients and customers reach you, 
and want you.

Enter your branding.

Your brand will help you target, gain work, beat competitors and sell.

The brand has to relate to your vision and your values. This will help 
reach the audience you need to make your startup a success.

Consider your tone. Think about your visual language. Make it clean and 
concise. Make it something that will become identifiable. Make it eye 
catching. Make it beautiful. Keep it simple.

“Determine who you are and what your brand is, and what you’re not. The 
rest of it is just a lot of noise.” — Geoffrey Zakarian

5. Decide on what platforms to market on.
This one shouldn’t be too difficult to nail down, as there are probably 
very few platforms that won’t be suitable.

You should be active on social media, regardless of how monotonous and
 painful it can be.

Get your startup’s social media accounts signed up, with all the relevant
 details added, and start building a following. Don’t spam your feeds with
  advertising and content pushing — remember to show the personal and human 
  side of your startup and it’s work.

Do you want to market through a website too? Don’t build a shit one. 
Too many fail to see the website as an extension of your startup, as part 
of the brand and portfolio.
Take some time and lots of effort on this one. Work on the looks. Get it 
running smoothly. Take some time to work on your SEO. And for the love of 
god, try to make it make it mobile friendly — this really matters these days!

There are many other avenues to market through, so take your time to decide 
what is best for your startup, and your target audience.

6. Do some maths.
Calculating figures of any form is a chore. Maths is horrible (and hard). 
And then there is the spreadsheets…

Unfortunately, it is essential.

Tackle this early on to determine a rough ‘bottom line’. You can use this as 
an indicator for what your startup needs to earn to survive. It dangerous
 to remain blind to this.

Add up your overheads. Add in projected wage costs. Add in expenses or 
purchases. Add in everything. Absolutely everything.

See that number, that looks frighteningly high? Thats your rough bottom 
line. I know, it hurts to look at.
That becomes the target, and the challenge becomes earning it, every, 
single, month.

7. Evaluate and highlight what areas you are short on.
This one requires a little honesty.

No matter if you think you can handle everything yourself, or within 
your wee team, you may be short. And thats ok.

You could be lacking in general manpower. It could also be something more 
specific. Is there a vital skillset missing within the team?
If so it is decision time. Is somebody taking on that job, and taking the 
time to learn the skill, or do you need to hire? Having calculated your bottom 
line, can you afford this? Is it a risk worth taking, perhaps in the short 
term, for long term gains?

If it is, get these guys on board, before the workload becomes too heavy. If 
it isn’t, throw yourself in the deep end and take on the challenge of learning 
a new role.

8. Set some goals.
This one is important.

You have to take baby steps in startup. Try not to aim for the top of the 
ladder before you have stepped on it. To prevent this, set some early goals.

It could be some sales targets, or maybe it is just getting the first sale. 
Maybe it is getting a website created. Getting the first prototype designed. 
Convincing the first 100 users to sign up to the app or website.

Whatever goals you set, try to keep them realistic, and reachable. It can be 
all too easy to shoot high - “lets make £1,000,000 this month!” — but these 
goals will remain unachieved and this can cause moral to drop.

You can always aim big, but but aim to get big in small, manageable steps.
